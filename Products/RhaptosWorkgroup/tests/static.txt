Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.RhaptosWorkgroup.ATWorkgroup import ATWorkgroup
    >>> ATWorkgroup.meta_type == 'WorkgroupAT'
    True
    >>> ATWorkgroup.portal_type == 'Workgroup'
    True
    >>> ATWorkgroup.archetype_name == 'Workgroup'
    True
    >>> ATWorkgroup.immediate_view == 'workspace_contents'
    True
    >>> ATWorkgroup.default_view == 'workspace_contents'
    True
    >>> type(ATWorkgroup.schema)
    <class 'Products.Archetypes.Schema.Schema'>
    >>> from Products.RhaptosWorkgroup.Workgroup import Workgroup
    >>> type(Workgroup.title)
    <type 'ComputedAttribute'>
    >>> type(Workgroup.email)
    <type 'ComputedAttribute'>
    >>> type(Workgroup.description)
    <type 'ComputedAttribute'>
    >>> Workgroup.meta_type == 'Workgroup'
    True
    >>> type(Workgroup.__implements__)
    <type 'tuple'>
